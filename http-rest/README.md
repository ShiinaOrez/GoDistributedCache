## HTTP-REST Cache Service

------

This part described a single point cache service: you can deploy it on your localhost or remote server, and use the **RESTful** request method such as **GET**, **PUT** and **DELETE** to ``get``, ``set`` and ``delete`` a key-value pair in cache.

**Warning:** this cache service dosen't surpport the persistent data storage. So, if you lose data because you used the service, I will be very sorry that you **did not** read this warning carefully.

### Run My Code:

```bash
make && ./main
```

### Test My Code:

```bash
make test
```

### The END:

> Happy to Hack!!!
